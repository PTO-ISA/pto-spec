// ASL arrays require static bounds. The executable model uses S63 witnesses

// elements.
//
// Performance bound (issue #287): with the pinned ASLRef interpreter every
// whole-tile operation step moves the full 32,768-element payload and its
// definedness bitmap regardless of the valid region, measured at roughly
// 4 s per step (3.8-4.0 s per PE on a 4-PE BSTART.TSTORE, 2026-09). Callers
// running bounded ELF consistency checks should size per-step timeouts
// accordingly (for example --timeout-s 600 for 4-PE runs). Implementations
// may accelerate the payload path by sparse indexing, vectorization, or
// equivalent means provided observable semantics are unchanged.
