# C.MOVR

**Normative ASL source:** `asl/scalar/alu/C.MOVR.asl`

C.MOVR snapshots a Reg5 source and publishes the complete XLEN value unchanged through RegDst.

## Normative identity {#PTO-INST-SCALAR-C-MOVR}

<!-- ndf: kind=executable level=L3 layer=scalar status=accepted -->

The current instruction contract is owned by the ASL source linked above.

## What C.MOVR does

`C.MOVR` is a 16-bit scalar ALU instruction. It forwards the snapshotted scalar source without changing its bit pattern; its current instruction contract defines the result publication path and any additional state effect.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: scalar-c-movr-mechanism role=mechanism -->
## How the result is formed

Execution snapshots the encoded inputs, then forwards the snapshotted scalar source without changing its bit pattern, and only afterward performs the destination effects.

- The operation-specific width, signedness, and immediate rules are fixed by the mnemonic and the encoded fields shown below.
- Result publication uses the width and extension rule fixed by this mnemonic's current contract.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: scalar-c-movr-inputs role=inputs-outputs -->
## Inputs and destinations

- The 5-bit `RegDst` field selects the Reg5 result target or discards the result.
- The 5-bit `SrcL` field selects a scalar input through Reg5.

These roles come from the current instruction contract. T/U sources are read and snapshotted without being removed from their queues; exact encoded-zero meanings appear in the generated defaults below.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: scalar-c-movr-effects role=effects -->
## Effects and ordering

Every scalar source is snapshotted before the destination effect. The completed value is then routed through `RegDst` using the current scalar destination map.

This ALU operation has no memory effect. After its successful architectural effects, `TPC` advances by 2 bytes.

The operation does not introduce a hidden scalar publication target or an implicit memory access. Architectural changes remain limited to the state effects enumerated by the current contract.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: scalar-c-movr-constraints role=constraints -->
## Legality and fault boundary

Materialization, movement, and extension are total at their fixed widths and do not raise arithmetic exceptions. A fixed-bit mismatch or unavailable selected T/U source faults before state effects.

The generated legality table is authoritative for assigned field values, reserved encodings, and destination discard codes. Decode and source availability are checked before architectural effects.

## Non-normative worked example

This example illustrates the current ASL owner and does not replace the normative operation.

For a small `C.MOVR` example, source bit pattern `0x1234` is published unchanged.

## Encoding class

## Encoded field closure

Every encoded field value is assigned here, owned by another mnemonic, or reserved by the normative ASL contract.

| Form | Field | Bits | Assigned | Other owner | Reserved | Architectural role | Encoded zero |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| c_movr_16_80d2b5f3580b | RegDst | 5 | 0–31 | none | none | Reg5 destination or discard | Encoded zero discards the result. |
| c_movr_16_80d2b5f3580b | SrcL | 5 | 0–31 | none | none | Reg5 source | Encoded zero reads the architectural zero GPR. |

## Operands and results

| Field | Architectural role |
| --- | --- |

## Defaults and encoded zero

- Every encoded source, immediate, and explicit destination field is required; no field can be omitted.
- The mnemonic fixes immediate signedness, selected source width, and implicit-versus-explicit destination behavior.

## Legality

- SrcL codes 0..23 select absolute GPRs, 24..27 select T#1..T#4, and 28..31 select U#1..U#4 without consumption.
- RegDst codes 0 and 24..29 discard, codes 1..23 write GPRs, code 30 pushes U, and code 31 pushes T.
- Every encoded operand value is assigned; fixed encoding bits must match the canonical form.

## State effects

- Return the complete snapshotted SrcL value without conversion.
- Publish the complete XLEN result through the common Reg5 destination map. Relative sources are non-consuming; only a T or U destination push changes a temporary queue.
- No memory, reservation, descriptor, numeric-status, block, privilege, branch-target, or other control state changes. Successful execution advances TPC by two bytes.

## Memory effects and ordering

### Memory effects

- none

### Ordering

- Snapshot any Reg5 source before the destination effect.
- Publish the result, then advance TPC by the encoded instruction length.

## Exceptions

- Materialization, movement, and extension are total fixed-width operations and raise no arithmetic exception.
- An unavailable selected T/U source raises Fault_IllegalInstruction before the destination effect and before TPC advances.

## Examples

- c.movr srcl, ->{t, u, rd}
