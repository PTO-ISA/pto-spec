# XORIW

**Normative ASL source:** `asl/scalar/alu/XORIW.asl`

XORIW performs word exclusive-or with a signed 12-bit immediate and sign-extends the result.

The current instruction contract is owned by the ASL source linked above.

## What XORIW does

`XORIW` is a 32-bit scalar ALU instruction. It performs bitwise exclusive OR under the low 32-bit word, followed by sign-extension to XLEN result rules; its current instruction contract defines the result publication path and any additional state effect.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: scalar-xoriw-mechanism role=mechanism -->
## How the result is formed

Execution snapshots the encoded inputs, then performs bitwise exclusive OR under the low 32-bit word, followed by sign-extension to XLEN result rules, and only afterward performs the destination effects.

- The immediate width and extension rule come from the encoded field shown below; encoded zero supplies numeric zero unless the generated contract states another zero meaning.
- Result publication uses the width and extension rule fixed by this mnemonic's current contract.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: scalar-xoriw-inputs role=inputs-outputs -->
## Inputs and destinations

- The 5-bit `RegDst` field selects the Reg5 scalar result target or discards the result.
- The 5-bit `SrcL` field selects a Reg5 scalar value whose low 32 bits participate.
- The signed 12-bit `simm12` field carries the signed 12-bit immediate.

These roles come from the current instruction contract. T/U sources are read and snapshotted without being removed from their queues; exact encoded-zero meanings appear in the generated defaults below.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: scalar-xoriw-effects role=effects -->
## Effects and ordering

Every scalar source is snapshotted before the destination effect. The completed value is then routed through `RegDst` using the current scalar destination map.

This ALU operation has no memory effect. After its successful architectural effects, `TPC` advances by 4 bytes.

The operation does not introduce a hidden scalar publication target or an implicit memory access. Architectural changes remain limited to the state effects enumerated by the current contract.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: scalar-xoriw-constraints role=constraints -->
## Legality and fault boundary

Fixed-width arithmetic follows the operation’s wraparound rule without an arithmetic exception. A fixed-bit mismatch or unavailable selected T/U source raises `Fault_IllegalInstruction` before publication and before `TPC` advances.

The generated legality table is authoritative for assigned field values, reserved encodings, and destination discard codes. Decode and source availability are checked before architectural effects.

## Non-normative worked example

This example illustrates the current ASL owner and does not replace the normative operation.

For a small `XORIW` example, `SrcL=0xc` and `simm12=0xa` produce `0x6`.

## Encoded field closure

Every encoded field value is assigned here, owned by another mnemonic, or reserved by the normative ASL contract.

| Form | Field | Bits | Assigned | Other owner | Reserved | Architectural role | Encoded zero |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| xoriw_32_1f8c6f43e2bd | RegDst | 5 | 0–31 | none | none | Reg5 scalar destination or discard selector | Encoded zero discards the result and does not modify any GPR or queue. |
| xoriw_32_1f8c6f43e2bd | SrcL | 5 | 0–31 | none | none | Reg5 scalar source; only bits 31:0 participate | Encoded zero reads the architectural zero GPR. |
| xoriw_32_1f8c6f43e2bd | simm12 | 12 | 0–4095 | none | none | signed 12-bit immediate | Encoded zero supplies numeric zero. |

## Operands and results

## Defaults and encoded zero

- SrcL, simm12, and RegDst are required encoded fields; no field can be omitted.
- simm12 is a signed 12-bit immediate from -2048 through 2047. Encoded zero supplies numeric zero.

## Legality

- All 32 SrcL encodings are assigned: 0..23 select absolute GPRs, 24..27 select T#1..T#4, and 28..31 select U#1..U#4 without consuming a queue entry.
- All 32 RegDst encodings are assigned: codes 0 and 24..29 discard, code 30 pushes U, code 31 pushes T, and codes 1..23 write absolute GPRs.
- Every signed 12-bit immediate from -2048 through 2047 is legal. Only the low 32 bits of SrcL and the sign-extended immediate participate.

## State effects

- Sign-extend simm12, XOR its low 32 bits with the low 32 bits of SrcL, then produce a 32-bit result sign-extended to XLEN and publish it through RegDst.
- Codes 1..23 write a GPR; codes 0 and 24..29 discard; code 30 pushes U; code 31 pushes T. Source queue selections are non-consuming.
- No memory, reservation, descriptor, block, privilege, numeric-flag, or control-flow state changes other than TPC advancing by four bytes after success.

## Memory effects and ordering

### Memory effects

- none

### Ordering

- Snapshot SrcL before the destination effect. Repeated source and destination selectors therefore read the pre-instruction value.
- Successful execution publishes the sign-extended word result and then advances TPC by four bytes.

## Exceptions

- XORIW raises no arithmetic exception; word exclusive-or and final sign extension are defined for every source and simm12 bit pattern.
- A fixed-bit mismatch or unavailable selected T/U source raises Fault_IllegalInstruction before the destination effect and before TPC advances.

## Examples

- xoriw a0, -1, ->a0
- xoriw u#1, 2047, ->t
- xoriw zero, -2048, ->zero
