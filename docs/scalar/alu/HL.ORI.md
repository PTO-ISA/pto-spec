# HL.ORI

**Normative ASL source:** `asl/scalar/alu/HL.ORI.asl`

HL.ORI applies XLEN bitwise inclusive-or to SrcL and a sign-extended 24-bit immediate.

## Normative identity {#PTO-INST-SCALAR-HL-ORI}

## Encoded field closure

Every encoded field value is assigned here, owned by another mnemonic, or reserved by the normative ASL contract.

| Form | Field | Bits | Assigned | Other owner | Reserved | Architectural role | Encoded zero |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| hl_ori_48_c6d8ce28a78b | RegDst | 5 | 0–31 | none | none | Reg5 scalar destination or discard selector | Encoded zero discards the result and does not modify any GPR or queue. |
| hl_ori_48_c6d8ce28a78b | SrcL | 5 | 0–31 | none | none | Reg5 scalar source | Encoded zero reads architectural GPR zero. |
| hl_ori_48_c6d8ce28a78b | simm24 | 24 | 0–16777215 | none | none | signed split 24-bit immediate | Encoded zero supplies numeric zero. |

## Operands and results

| Field | Architectural role |

## Defaults and encoded zero

- SrcL, simm24, and RegDst are required encoded fields; no field can be omitted.
- simm24 has the complete signed 24-bit range -8388608 through 8388607; encoded zero is numeric zero.

## Legality

- All 32 SrcL encodings are assigned: 0..23 select absolute GPRs, 24..27 select T#1..T#4, and 28..31 select U#1..U#4 without consuming a queue entry.
- All 32 RegDst encodings are assigned: codes 0 and 24..29 discard, codes 1..23 write absolute GPRs, code 30 pushes U, and code 31 pushes T.
- Every signed 24-bit two's-complement value is assigned. The two 12-bit pieces reconstruct one exact 24-bit value.

## State effects

- Sign-extend simm24 to PTO_XLEN, compute bitwise inclusive-or with the snapshotted SrcL value modulo 2^PTO_XLEN where applicable, and publish the result through RegDst.
- Codes 1..23 write a GPR; codes 0 and 24..29 discard; code 30 pushes U; code 31 pushes T. Relative source reads are non-consuming.
- No memory, reservation, descriptor, Tile, block, privilege, numeric-status, branch-target, or other control state changes. Successful execution advances TPC by six bytes.

## Memory effects and ordering

### Memory effects

- none

### Ordering

- Snapshot SrcL before the destination effect, including GPR aliases and same-queue read-then-push cases.
- Publish the result through RegDst, then advance TPC by six bytes.

## Exceptions

- HL.ORI raises no arithmetic exception; fixed-width overflow or underflow is discarded.
- A fixed-bit mismatch or unavailable selected T/U source raises Fault_IllegalInstruction before any destination effect and before TPC advances.

## Examples

- hl.ori a0, -1, ->a0
- hl.ori t#1, -8388608, ->u
- hl.ori zero, 8388607, ->zero
