# C.SSRGET

**Normative ASL source:** `asl/scalar/sys/C.SSRGET.asl`

Execute the C.SSRGET scalar instruction contract.

## Normative identity {#PTO-INST-SCALAR-C-SSRGET}

<!-- ndf: kind=executable level=L3 layer=scalar status=accepted -->

The current instruction contract is owned by the ASL source linked above.

## Assembly

```asm
