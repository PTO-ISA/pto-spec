# LWU

**Normative ASL source:** `asl/scalar/agu/LWU.asl`

LWU snapshots its scalar sources, forms its encoded address, and loads one aligned little-endian 4-byte value.

## Normative identity {#PTO-INST-SCALAR-LWU}

## What LWU does

`LWU` is a standalone `32`-bit AGU instruction that forms a register-offset address and loads one aligned little-endian `4`-byte value.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: scalar-lwu-mechanism role=mechanism -->
## Address and memory mechanism

`LWU` transforms `SrcR` according to `SrcRType`, shifts the transformed value left by the encoded `shamt`, and adds it modulo `2^PTO_XLEN` to the snapshotted `SrcL` base.

After complete preflight, the instruction performs one little-endian `4`-byte load and zero-extends the loaded `4`-byte value to `PTO_XLEN` for destination publication.

This form performs no base-register writeback; its effective address is used only by the selected memory operation.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: scalar-lwu-inputs role=inputs-outputs -->
## Inputs and outputs

- `SrcL` supplies the base; `SrcR` supplies the offset; `SrcRType` supplies the offset transformation. Every encoded Reg5 source among `SrcL`, `SrcR` uses codes `0..23` for GPRs, `24..27` for `T#1..T#4`, and `28..31` for `U#1..U#4` without consumption.
- `RegDst` receives the loaded result; destination codes `1..23` write GPRs, `30` pushes U, `31` pushes T, and `0` plus `24..29` discard only that result.
- All `SrcRType` values `0..3` and all `shamt` values `0..31` are assigned; transformation precedes the encoded shift.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: scalar-lwu-effects role=effects -->
## Effects and ordering

All explicit and implicit scalar sources are snapshotted before memory or destination effects, so aliases observe pre-instruction values.

A successful attempt records one relaxed load event, preserves memory and reservation state, publishes or discards the loaded value, and advances `TPC` by `4` bytes.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: scalar-lwu-constraints role=constraints -->
## Alignment, faults, and restart

Each effective address must satisfy `4`-byte alignment. Misalignment raises `Fault_DataAlignment` before translation; a later permission or bounded-memory failure raises `Fault_DataPage` at the original address.

A fault records no successful memory event, performs no partial memory, destination, or writeback effect, preserves pending writeback, and leaves the faulting `TPC` available for full reissue.

A fixed-bit mismatch, reserved field value, or unavailable selected `T`/`U` source raises `Fault_IllegalInstruction` before instruction effects.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: scalar-lwu-example role=example -->
## Non-normative address example

This example demonstrates the address calculation only; exact behavior remains in the current ASL and instruction contract.

With base `0x100`, unchanged offset source `2`, and `shamt=1`, the offset is `4` and base plus offset is `0x104`. The memory access uses `0x104`. If aligned and permitted, the instruction loads `4` bytes from that address.

## Defaults and encoded zero

- Every displayed operand field is encoded explicitly; encoded zero is a value and never denotes omission.
- SrcRType=0 sign-extends SrcR[31:0], SrcRType=1 zero-extends SrcR[31:0], SrcRType=2 negates the full PTO_XLEN value, and SrcRType=3 leaves the complete PTO_XLEN value unchanged. Encoded shamt zero performs no shift.

## Legality

- Every encoded Reg5 source uses the complete domain: codes 0..23 select absolute GPRs, codes 24..27 select T#1..T#4, and codes 28..31 select U#1..U#4 without consumption.
- Every Reg5 destination is assigned: codes 1..23 write GPRs, code 30 pushes U, code 31 pushes T, and codes 0 and 24..29 discard only that result.
- All four SrcRType values and all shamt values 0..31 are assigned; apply the modifier before the shift.
- Each memory address must be aligned to the 4-byte access size; a 4-byte access is the complete transfer unit.

## State effects

- Form offset = LSL(Modify(SrcR, SrcRType), the encoded shamt) and add it modulo 2^PTO_XLEN to the SrcL base.
- After a successful 4-byte load, zero-extend the loaded value to PTO_XLEN and publish it through the destination.
- Successful execution advances TPC by 4 bytes; a rejected or faulting attempt does not retire.

## Memory effects and ordering

### Memory effects

- After complete preflight, perform one little-endian 4-byte load and record one relaxed load event.
- The load preserves memory and reservation state.

### Ordering

- Snapshot all explicit and implicit scalar sources before destination or memory effects; duplicate and source/destination aliases observe pre-instruction values.
- Complete the relaxed 4-byte memory operation, publish any result or writeback, and then advance TPC.

## Exceptions

- A fixed-bit mismatch, reserved field value, or unavailable selected T/U source raises Fault_IllegalInstruction before instruction effects.
- A misaligned 4-byte address raises Fault_DataAlignment before translation or permission. A later permission or bounded-memory failure raises Fault_DataPage at the original address.
- A fault emits no successful memory event, performs no partial memory or destination effect, preserves pending writeback, and leaves TPC at the faulting instruction.
- Recovery performs a full reissue: every address, source snapshot, preflight, memory operation, and destination is recomputed with no retained progress.
