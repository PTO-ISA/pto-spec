## Encoding class

- **Class:** `standalone-encoded`
- **Standalone opcode:** `yes`

## Encoded field closure

Every encoded field value is assigned here, owned by another mnemonic, or reserved by the normative ASL contract.

| Form | Field | Bits | Assigned | Other owner | Reserved | Architectural role | Encoded zero |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| hl_lbi_po_48_afbc00c48aba | RegDst0 | 5 | 0–31 | none | none | Reg5 first loaded-value destination or discard | Encoded zero discards this result without suppressing the instruction's other effects. |
| hl_lbi_po_48_afbc00c48aba | RegDst1 | 5 | 0–31 | none | none | Reg5 updated-base destination or discard | Encoded zero discards this result without suppressing the instruction's other effects. |
| hl_lbi_po_48_afbc00c48aba | SrcL | 5 | 0–31 | none | none | Reg5 address-base source | Encoded zero reads the architectural zero GPR. |
| hl_lbi_po_48_afbc00c48aba | simm17 | 17 | 0–131071 | none | none | signed address displacement | Encoded zero supplies a zero displacement; it does not denote omission. |

## Operands and results

| Field | Architectural role |
| --- | --- |
| RegDst0 | Reg5 first loaded-value destination or discard |
| RegDst1 | Reg5 updated-base destination or discard |
| SrcL | Reg5 address-base source |
| simm17 | signed address displacement |

## Defaults and encoded zero

- Every displayed operand field is encoded explicitly; encoded zero is a value and never denotes omission.

## Legality

- Every encoded Reg5 source uses the complete domain: codes 0..23 select absolute GPRs, codes 24..27 select T#1..T#4, and codes 28..31 select U#1..U#4 without consumption.
- Every Reg5 destination is assigned: codes 1..23 write GPRs, code 30 pushes U, code 31 pushes T, and codes 0 and 24..29 discard only that result.
- simm17 assigns every signed 17-bit value -65536..65535; the encoded byte displacement is that value multiplied by 1.
- Each memory address must be aligned to the 1-byte access size; a 1-byte access is the complete transfer unit.

## State effects

- Sign-extend simm17, multiply it by 1, and add it modulo 2^PTO_XLEN to the SrcL base.
- Post-index mode accesses the original base and publishes base plus offset only after successful memory completion.
- After a successful 1-byte load, sign-extend the loaded value to PTO_XLEN and publish it through the destination.
- Successful execution advances TPC by 6 bytes; a rejected or faulting attempt does not retire.

## Memory effects and ordering

### Memory effects

- After complete preflight, perform one little-endian 1-byte load and record one relaxed load event.
- The load preserves memory and reservation state.

### Ordering

- Snapshot all explicit and implicit scalar sources before destination or memory effects; duplicate and source/destination aliases observe pre-instruction values.
- Complete the relaxed 1-byte memory operation, publish any result or writeback, and then advance TPC.

## Exceptions

- A fixed-bit mismatch, reserved field value, or unavailable selected T/U source raises Fault_IllegalInstruction before instruction effects.
- A misaligned 1-byte address raises Fault_DataAlignment before translation or permission. A later permission or bounded-memory failure raises Fault_DataPage at the original address.
- A fault emits no successful memory event, performs no partial memory or destination effect, preserves pending writeback, and leaves TPC at the faulting instruction.
- Recovery performs a full reissue: every address, source snapshot, preflight, memory operation, and destination is recomputed with no retained progress.
