## Field value dispositions

### DataType (`PTO-FIELD-BLOCK-DATATYPE`)

Selects the Tile element data type carried by Block data attributes and typed Block starts.

**Encoded zero:** Code zero selects FP64; zero never means absent, inherited, NONE, or NULL.

| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | assigned | FP64 |
| 1 | assigned | FP32 |
| 2 | assigned | TF32 |

| 29 | reserved | future extension |
| 30 | reserved | future extension |
| 31 | reserved | future extension |

**Reserved-value behavior:** Reserved values are held for future extension and reject before architectural effects.

## Encoded field closure

Every encoded field value is assigned here, owned by another mnemonic, or reserved by the normative ASL contract.

| Form | Field | Bits | Assigned | Other owner | Reserved | Architectural role | Encoded zero |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bstart_tmatmulmx_bias_32_098c7efa51b0 | DataType | 5 | 0–14, 16–20, 24–28 | none | 15, 21–23, 29–31 | tile element data type selector | Encoded zero selects FP64. |

- `bstart_tmatmulmx_bias_32_098c7efa51b0.DataType` reserved values: Reserved encodings raise Fault_IllegalInstruction before architectural effects.

## Operands and results

| Field | Architectural role |

## Defaults and encoded zero

- Encoded DataType is always AType. Omitted B.DATR preserves AType as BType, selects RNE, and disables saturation.
- Omitted LB0, LB1, and LB2 default M, N, and K independently to one.
- Exactly one all-zero B.FPATR selects no conversion, activation, or reduction; B.IOR and auxiliary B.IOT operands exist only when a selected postprocess mode requires them.
- Local A uses persistent CUBE_M16 or CUBE_M32, Local B uses persistent CUBE_N8, and D is newly allocated in A's M layout. M, N, and K are arbitrary positive values independent of per-PE TSize. Bias remains an ordinary row-major 1xN accumulator-type Tile. Required E8M0 scales remain ordinary row-major Tiles.

## Legality

- The carrier selects exactly CUBE Function 5 and TileOperation_TMATMUL_MX_BIAS.
- Local A uses persistent CUBE_M16 or CUBE_M32, Local B uses persistent CUBE_N8, and D is newly allocated in A's M layout. M, N, and K are arbitrary positive values independent of per-PE TSize. Bias remains an ordinary row-major 1xN accumulator-type Tile. Required E8M0 scales remain ordinary row-major Tiles.
- Each matrix side independently requires an E8M0 scale exactly when its MX input type is not FP16 or BF16. Bias is one Local row-major 1xN accumulator-type source. Published Shared operands may replace the right group or both matrix groups; supplementary operands and destinations remain Local.
- Every executing Local or Shared binding uses PE_MASK=1111; mask zero is a strict no-op before descriptor reads, faults, allocation, readiness checks, or lifetime effects.
- B.DATR permits only BType, RMode, and Sat. Exactly one B.FPATR is mandatory and closes the conditional postprocess schema.

## State effects

- Start a CUBE Function 5 descriptor with encoded DataType preserved as AType.
- At block completion execute TileOperation_TMATMUL_MX_BIAS using the resolved M, N, K, input types, mathematical operands, and B.FPATR postprocess schema.
- Publish the complete output group atomically after successful preflight and computation; do not consume mathematical or postprocess sources.
- For Local execution, publish D with A's CUBE_M16 or CUBE_M32 layout and final output dtype; ordinary Bias, MX scales, and enabled reduction auxiliaries keep their operation-owned layouts.

## Memory effects and ordering

### Memory effects

- none

### Ordering

- Complete schema, field, type, dimension, descriptor, shape, capacity, readiness, alias, and allocation preflight precedes every source snapshot and destination effect.
- D and every enabled reduction output publish as one atomic group; rejection publishes none and successful sources persist.

## Exceptions

- A reserved DataType or fixed-bit mismatch raises Fault_IllegalInstruction before block state changes.
- Missing, duplicate, or non-Matrix B.FPATR use raises Fault_BundleControl before allocation or payload effects.
- Illegal types, dimensions, masks, binding streams, descriptors, shapes, capacities, aliases, readiness, or postprocess values raise Fault_TileLegality before source snapshots and effects.

## Examples

- BSTART.TMATMULMX.BIAS AType; B.DATR BType, RMode, Sat (optional; BType defaults to AType); B.FPATR PreQuantMode, ReluMode, GroupNCode, RowMaxEn, GroupMaxEn, RowMaxInit, MaxAbsEn (exactly one); B.DIM LB0 M (optional, default 1); B.DIM LB1 N (optional, default 1); B.DIM LB2 K (optional, default 1); B.IOS complete right or both matrix operand groups (optional; executing mask 1111); B.IOT ordered Local mathematical sources: A CUBE_M16/M32 primary, optional A scale, B CUBE_N8 primary, optional B scale, 1xN Bias; B.IOT D matching A's CUBE_M16/M32 layout, optional RowMaxOut, optional GroupMaxOut destinations; B.IOT/B.IOR postprocess operands selected by B.FPATR; BSTOP or the next BSTART completion boundary
