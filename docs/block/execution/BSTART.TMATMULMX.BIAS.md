## What BSTART.TMATMULMX.BIAS does

`BSTART.TMATMULMX.BIAS` opens an active Block descriptor for `TileOperation_TMATMUL_MX_BIAS`; the body supplies the attributes and bindings required before completion.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: block-bstart-tmatmulmx-bias-mechanism role=mechanism -->
## Placement and execution mechanism

`BSTART.TMATMULMX.BIAS` must appear as the starter of its Block. Later attributes, dimensions, and bindings accumulate in the active descriptor until `BSTOP` or the next accepted `BSTART` completion boundary.

The accepted carrier uses the `L32` encoding class and resolves every displayed field before the command reads bindings or changes state.

At completion, the descriptor runs `TileOperation_TMATMUL_MX_BIAS` only after schema, type, dimension, descriptor, readiness, alias, and capacity preflight succeeds.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: block-bstart-tmatmulmx-bias-inputs role=inputs-outputs -->
## Carrier, bindings, and inputs

- Encoded operands: `DataType` — tile element data type selector.
- The Block schema is completed by the ordered companion carriers `BSTART.TMATMULMX.BIAS`, `B.DATR`, `B.FPATR`, `B.DIM`, `B.IOS`, `B.IOT`, `B.IOT/B.IOR`; omitted optional carriers take only the defaults named by this owner.
- Encoded zero remains an assigned value or a specifically documented rejection; it never silently means an omitted operand.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: block-bstart-tmatmulmx-bias-effects role=effects -->
## State effects and ordering

Starting the Block records the selected carrier and leaves operation execution deferred until the completion boundary.

After complete preflight and computation, every enabled output publishes as the owner-defined atomic group; successful mathematical sources remain available unless the contract explicitly consumes them.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: block-bstart-tmatmulmx-bias-constraints role=constraints -->
## Legality, faults, and atomicity

Fixed bits, reserved values, selector domains, and required Block placement are checked before architectural effects.

The current owner reports invalid schema, state, address, or continuation conditions through `Fault_BundleControl`, `Fault_IllegalInstruction`, `Fault_TileLegality`; no prose on this page creates an additional fault rule.

Complete schema, binding, readiness, alias, capacity, and allocation preflight precedes source snapshots and every destination publication.

## Non-normative worked example

This example demonstrates placement and carrier flow only; exact behavior remains in the current ASL and instruction contract.

```asm
BSTART.TMATMULMX.BIAS AType; B.DATR BType, RMode, Sat (optional; BType defaults to AType); B.FPATR PreQuantMode, ReluMode, GroupNCode, RowMaxEn, GroupMaxEn, RowMaxInit, MaxAbsEn, TransA, TransB, CScaleEn (exactly one); B.DIM LB0 M or cooperative group_M (optional, default 1); B.DIM LB1 N (optional, default 1); B.DIM LB2 K (optional, default 1); B.IOS complete right or both matrix operand groups (optional; cooperative mask 1111); B.IOT ordered Local mathematical sources: A CUBE_M16/M32 primary, optional A scale, B CUBE_N8 primary, optional B scale, 1xN Bias; B.IOT D matching A's CUBE_M16/M32 layout, optional RowMaxOut, optional GroupMaxOut destinations; B.IOT/B.IOR postprocess operands selected by B.FPATR; BSTOP or the next BSTART completion boundary
```

The starter establishes the descriptor first; the following carriers fill its declared schema, and the final completion boundary triggers validation and operation execution.

## Field value dispositions

### DataType (`PTO-FIELD-BLOCK-DATATYPE`)

Selects the Tile element data type carried by Block data attributes and typed Block starts.

**Encoded zero:** Code zero selects FP64; zero never means absent, inherited, NONE, or NULL.

| Code | Disposition | Meaning |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | assigned | FP64 |
| 1 | assigned | FP32 |
| 2 | assigned | TF32 |
| 3 | assigned | HF32 |

| 27 | assigned | U8 |
| 28 | assigned | U4X2 |
| 29 | reserved | future extension |
| 30 | reserved | future extension |
| 31 | reserved | future extension |

**Reserved-value behavior:** Reserved values are held for future extension and reject before architectural effects.

## Encoded field closure

Every encoded field value is assigned here, owned by another mnemonic, or reserved by the normative ASL contract.

| Form | Field | Bits | Assigned | Other owner | Reserved | Architectural role | Encoded zero |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bstart_tmatmulmx_bias_32_098c7efa51b0 | DataType | 5 | 0–14, 16–20, 24–28 | none | 15, 21–23, 29–31 | tile element data type selector | Encoded zero selects FP64. |

- `bstart_tmatmulmx_bias_32_098c7efa51b0.DataType` reserved values: Reserved encodings raise Fault_IllegalInstruction before architectural effects.

## Operands and results

## Defaults and encoded zero

- Encoded DataType is always AType. Omitted B.DATR preserves AType as BType, selects RNE, and disables saturation.
- Omitted LB0 defaults Local M or cooperative group_M to one; omitted LB1 and LB2 default N and K to one.
- Exactly one all-zero B.FPATR selects no conversion, activation, or reduction; B.IOR and auxiliary B.IOT operands exist only when a selected postprocess mode requires them.
- Local A uses persistent CUBE_M16 or CUBE_M32, Local B uses persistent CUBE_N8, and D is newly allocated in A's M layout. M, N, and K are arbitrary positive values independent of per-PE TSize. Bias remains an ordinary row-major 1xN accumulator-type Tile. Each side uses group-32 E8M0 or HiF4X2 group-64 U32 scale; Local scales use CUBE_M32 and Shared scales remain ordinary Tiles.
- TransA=0 and TransB=0 select no logical transpose. Each nonzero control is legal only when the corresponding primary is Shared.

## Legality

- The carrier selects exactly CUBE Function 5 and TileOperation_TMATMUL_MX_BIAS.
- Local A uses persistent CUBE_M16 or CUBE_M32, Local B uses persistent CUBE_N8, and D is newly allocated in A's M layout. M, N, and K are arbitrary positive values independent of per-PE TSize. Bias remains an ordinary row-major 1xN accumulator-type Tile. Each side uses group-32 E8M0 or HiF4X2 group-64 U32 scale; Local scales use CUBE_M32 and Shared scales remain ordinary Tiles.
- A Shared primary must be fully published with all four fixed quarters ready. Any cooperative Local-A/Shared-B or Shared-A/Shared-B TMATMUL interprets LB0 as Core-total group_M in 1..128; Shared A has shape group_MxK, Shared B has shape KxN, and PE i uses valid_M=clamp(group_M-i*M_per_PE,0,M_per_PE) with M_per_PE 16 or 32. TransA and TransB apply only to their corresponding Shared primary. Right-only Shared inherits Local A layout; all-Shared ACC inherits C layout; all-Shared non-ACC selects M16 through M=16 and M32 through M=32.
- Each non-FP16/BF16 side requires its assigned scale: group-32 E8M0 for MX FP8/FP4 or group-64 U32 for HiF4X2. Bias is one Local row-major 1xN accumulator-type source. Published Shared operands may replace the right group or both matrix groups; supplementary operands and destinations remain Local.
- Every cooperative nonzero PE_MASK must be 1111; all four PEs complete Shared readiness, while zero-row PEs suppress every compute-only Local resolution and effect. Mask zero is a strict no-op before descriptor reads, faults, allocation, readiness checks, or lifetime effects.
- B.DATR permits only BType, RMode, and Sat. Exactly one B.FPATR is mandatory and closes the conditional postprocess schema.

## State effects

- Start a CUBE Function 5 descriptor with encoded DataType preserved as AType.
- At block completion execute TileOperation_TMATMUL_MX_BIAS using the resolved M, N, K, input types, mathematical operands, and B.FPATR postprocess schema.
- Publish the complete output group atomically after successful preflight and computation; do not consume mathematical or postprocess sources.
- For Local execution, publish D with A's CUBE_M16 or CUBE_M32 layout and final output dtype; ordinary Bias, MX scales, and enabled reduction auxiliaries keep their operation-owned layouts.
- Successful Shared primary reads leave every Shared descriptor, mask, publication state, payload, and lifetime unchanged.

## Memory effects and ordering

### Memory effects

- none

### Ordering

- Complete schema, field, type, dimension, descriptor, shape, capacity, readiness, alias, and allocation preflight precedes every source snapshot and destination effect.
- D and every enabled reduction output publish as one atomic group; rejection publishes none and successful sources persist.

## Exceptions

- A reserved DataType or fixed-bit mismatch raises Fault_IllegalInstruction before block state changes.
- Missing, duplicate, or non-Matrix B.FPATR use raises Fault_BundleControl before allocation or payload effects.
- Illegal types, dimensions, masks, binding streams, descriptors, shapes, capacities, aliases, readiness, or postprocess values raise Fault_TileLegality before source snapshots and effects.
