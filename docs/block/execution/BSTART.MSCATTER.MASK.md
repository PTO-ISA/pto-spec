## What BSTART.MSCATTER.MASK contributes

`BSTART.MSCATTER.MASK` is a 32-bit block-start command for the MSCATTER.MASK form. It establishes the pending block identity and selectors; the completed block, not the start command alone, owns body execution and result commitment.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: block-bstart-mscatter-mask-mechanism role=mechanism -->
## Placement and mechanism

Header commands execute sequentially after the start, while `BSTOP` or the next `BSTART` is the boundary that validates and retires the completed block. The current owner gives this exact composition checklist:

```text
BSTART.MSCATTER.MASK DataType
B.DATR Layout (optional)
B.DIM LB0=ValidCol
B.DIM LB1=ValidRow (optional)
B.DIM LB2=Col (optional)
B.IOT DataTile, IndexTile, mask=PE_MASK
B.IOT MaskTile, mask=PE_MASK, <last>
B.IOR BaseGPR, zero, zero, ->zero
BSTOP
```

After any active predecessor is retired successfully, the command initializes the new pending `BARG` or operation descriptor and continues header execution at the sequential PC. No block destination or memory result becomes visible merely because the start decoded.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: block-bstart-mscatter-mask-inputs role=inputs-outputs -->
## Operands and header roles

- `DataType` selects the element data type or inheritance sentinel; its exact assigned domain remains in the generated contract below.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: block-bstart-mscatter-mask-effects role=effects -->
## Pending state and completion

The start transition is all-or-nothing with predecessor retirement for applicability and target checks. After the start succeeds, the later completion boundary validates the full composition before any body result can commit.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: block-bstart-mscatter-mask-constraints role=constraints -->
## Legality and fault boundary

Reserved selectors, invalid targets, malformed completed composition, or failed predecessor retirement are rejected before new-block or body effects.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: block-bstart-mscatter-mask-example role=example -->
## Non-normative worked example

This worked example is non-normative; it illustrates the current owner without replacing it.

```asm
BSTART.MSCATTER.MASK DataType
```

Assume predecessor retirement and target checks succeed. `BSTART.MSCATTER.MASK DataType` opens the pending `BSTART.MSCATTER.MASK` form; subsequent header/body commands remain provisional until `BSTOP` or the next `BSTART` validates the complete composition.

## Encoding class

- **Class:** `standalone-encoded`
- **Standalone opcode:** `yes`

## Field value dispositions

### B.DATR.CMode (`PTO-FIELD-BLOCK-CMODE`)

Selects the operation-defined comparison or indexed-memory mode.

**Encoded zero:** Equality for comparisons; Row mode for indexed TLSU.

| Code | Disposition | Meaning |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | assigned | EQ-or-Row |
| 1 | assigned | NE-or-Elem |
| 2 | assigned | LT |
| 3 | assigned | GT |
| 4 | assigned | LE |
| 5 | assigned | GE |
| 6 | reserved | future extension |
| 7 | reserved | future extension |

**Reserved-value behavior:** Codes 6 and 7 are reserved and reject before architectural effects.

### DataType (`PTO-FIELD-BLOCK-DATATYPE`)

Selects the Tile element data type carried by Block data attributes and typed Block starts.

**Encoded zero:** Code zero selects FP64; zero never means absent, inherited, NONE, or NULL.

| Code | Disposition | Meaning |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | assigned | FP64 |
| 1 | assigned | FP32 |
| 2 | assigned | TF32 |
| 3 | assigned | HF32 |
| 4 | assigned | FP16 |

| 27 | assigned | U8 |
| 28 | assigned | U4X2 |
| 29 | reserved | future extension |
| 30 | reserved | future extension |
| 31 | reserved | future extension |

**Reserved-value behavior:** Reserved values are held for future extension and reject before architectural effects.

## Encoded field closure

Every encoded field value is assigned here, owned by another mnemonic, or reserved by the normative ASL contract.

| Form | Field | Bits | Assigned | Other owner | Reserved | Architectural role | Encoded zero |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bstart_mscatter_mask_32_2a33eed646f7 | DataType | 5 | 0–14, 16–20, 24–28 | none | 15, 21–23, 29–31 | memory transfer element type selector | Encoded zero selects FP64. |

- `bstart_mscatter_mask_32_2a33eed646f7.DataType` reserved values: Reserved encodings raise Fault_IllegalInstruction before architectural effects.

## Operands and results

| Field | Architectural role |
| --- | --- |
| DataType | memory transfer element type selector |
| B.IOR.RegSrc0 | per-PE private-GPR GM base address |
| B.IOR.RegSrc1 | per-PE private-GPR GM row stride in elements |

## Defaults and encoded zero

- DataType is always encoded and selects the memory transfer type.
- The completed schema requires explicit B.IOR: RegSrc0 supplies the per-PE GM base address and RegSrc1 supplies a nonzero GM row stride in elements no smaller than ValidCol. RegSrc2 and RegDst remain zero. Omitted LB1 defaults to one, omitted LB2 defaults to LB0, and omitted B.DATR uses the operation defaults.
- B.DATR CMode=0 selects Row mode and CMode=1 selects Elem mode; codes 2..5 are inapplicable. Row mode uses a canonical row-major 1 x ValidRow S32/U32 IndexTile and consumes RegSrc1 as a GM row stride in elements. Elem mode uses a row-major S32/U32 IndexTile matching the data valid shape, requires RegSrc1 to encode zero, and treats each index as a relative element displacement from BaseGPR.

## Legality

- bstart_mscatter_mask_32_2a33eed646f7.DataType accepts only 0..14, 16..20, and 24..28 at decode; all other encodings are reserved.
- Indexed TLSU transfer additionally rejects E2M1X2, E1M2X2, HiF4X2, S4X2, and U4X2 because no nibble selector is encoded.
- The body must complete the exact two-B.IOT schema documented by PTO-TILE-MSCATTER-MASK; no B.IOS or destination is accepted.
- B.IOR RegSrc0 supplies the per-PE GM base and RegSrc1 supplies the GM row stride in elements. RegSrc1 must be at least ValidCol; RegSrc2 and RegDst must be zero.
- For indexed TLSU, B.DATR CMode accepts only Row=0 and Elem=1; CMode 2..5 raises Fault_TileLegality before address generation or effects.
- Row mode requires a canonical row-major 1 x ValidRow S32/U32 IndexTile and a RegSrc1 row-stride value no smaller than ValidCol.
- Elem mode requires a row-major S32/U32 IndexTile matching the data valid shape and requires B.IOR RegSrc1, RegSrc2, and RegDst to encode zero.

## State effects

- Closes any preceding block, initializes a new TileMemory descriptor, and selects TLSU function 7 with encoded DataType.
- No Tile is allocated and no source is consumed by the start instruction.

## Memory effects and ordering

### Memory effects

- Row mode stores data coordinate (r,c) at BaseGPR + (IndexTile[0,r] * row_stride_elements + c) * sizeof(DataType).
- Elem mode stores data coordinate (r,c) at BaseGPR + IndexTile[r,c] * sizeof(DataType).

### Ordering

- The start defines no ordering. B.CATR attributes apply when the completed block commits.

## Exceptions

- Reserved DataType encodings raise Fault_IllegalInstruction before architectural effects.
- Malformed composition, invalid predicate values, type/shape/layout mismatch, packed transfer types, or enabled-lane access faults reject before any store or event.

## Examples

- BSTART.MSCATTER.MASK DataType; B.DATR Layout (optional); B.DIM LB0=ValidCol; B.DIM LB1=ValidRow (optional); B.DIM LB2=Col (optional); B.IOT DataTile, IndexTile, mask=PE_MASK; B.IOT MaskTile, mask=PE_MASK, <last>; B.IOR BaseGPR, StrideGPR, zero, ->zero; BSTOP
