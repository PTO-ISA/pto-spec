## What BSTART.MSCATTER.MASK contributes

`BSTART.MSCATTER.MASK` is a 32-bit block-start command for the MSCATTER.MASK form. It establishes the pending block identity and selectors; the completed block, not the start command alone, owns body execution and result commitment.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: block-bstart-mscatter-mask-mechanism role=mechanism -->
## Placement and mechanism

Header commands execute sequentially after the start, while `BSTOP` or the next `BSTART` is the boundary that validates and retires the completed block. The current owner gives this exact composition checklist:

```text
BSTART.MSCATTER.MASK DataType
B.DATR Layout (optional)
B.DIM LB0=ValidCol
B.DIM LB1=ValidRow (optional)
B.DIM LB2=Col (optional)
B.IOT DataTile, IndexTile, mask=PE_MASK
B.IOT MaskTile, mask=PE_MASK, <last>
B.IOR BaseGPR, zero, zero, ->zero
BSTOP
```

After any active predecessor is retired successfully, the command initializes the new pending `BARG` or operation descriptor and continues header execution at the sequential PC. No block destination or memory result becomes visible merely because the start decoded.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: block-bstart-mscatter-mask-inputs role=inputs-outputs -->
## Operands and header roles

- `DataType` selects the element data type or inheritance sentinel; its exact assigned domain remains in the generated contract below.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: block-bstart-mscatter-mask-effects role=effects -->
## Pending state and completion

The start transition is all-or-nothing with predecessor retirement for applicability and target checks. After the start succeeds, the later completion boundary validates the full composition before any body result can commit.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: block-bstart-mscatter-mask-constraints role=constraints -->
## Legality and fault boundary

Reserved selectors, invalid targets, malformed completed composition, or failed predecessor retirement are rejected before new-block or body effects.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: block-bstart-mscatter-mask-example role=example -->
## Non-normative worked example

This worked example is non-normative; it illustrates the current owner without replacing it.

```asm
BSTART.MSCATTER.MASK DataType
```

Assume predecessor retirement and target checks succeed. `BSTART.MSCATTER.MASK DataType` opens the pending `BSTART.MSCATTER.MASK` form; subsequent header/body commands remain provisional until `BSTOP` or the next `BSTART` validates the complete composition.

## Field value dispositions

### B.IOR.RegSrc0 (`PTO-FIELD-BLOCK-GPR-SELECTOR`)

Selects one absolute architectural GPR for B.IOR input or output binding.

**Encoded zero:** Code zero names the architectural zero GPR; it never means an omitted B.IOR field.

| Code | Disposition | Meaning |

| 2 | assigned | a0 |

| 30 | reserved | future extension |
| 31 | reserved | future extension |

**Reserved-value behavior:** Selectors 24 through 31 are reserved and raise Fault_IllegalInstruction before binding state changes.

## Encoded field closure

Every encoded field value is assigned here, owned by another mnemonic, or reserved by the normative ASL contract.

| Form | Field | Bits | Assigned | Other owner | Reserved | Architectural role | Encoded zero |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bstart_mscatter_mask_32_2a33eed646f7 | DataType | 5 | 0–14, 16–20, 24–28 | none | 15, 21–23, 29–31 | memory transfer element type selector | Encoded zero supplies numeric zero for the memory transfer element type selector. |

- `bstart_mscatter_mask_32_2a33eed646f7.DataType` reserved values: Reserved encodings raise Fault_IllegalInstruction before architectural effects.

## Operands and results

| Field | Architectural role |
| --- | --- |
| DataType | memory transfer element type selector |
| B.IOR.RegSrc0 | per-PE private-GPR GM base address |
| B.IOR.RegSrc1 | per-PE private-GPR zero selector |

## Defaults and encoded zero

- B.IOR is required: RegSrc0 selects the per-PE BaseGPR; RegSrc1, RegSrc2, and RegDst must encode zero.
- LB0 supplies DataTile ValidCol, LB1 supplies ValidRow, and LB2 supplies DataTile or destination physical Col; omitted LB1 and LB2 default to one and LB0 respectively.
- IndexTile entries are S32, U32, S64, or U64 byte displacements and are not scaled or decomposed.

## Legality

- PredicateTile is an ordinary Local U8 predicate carrier with one 0x00 or 0x01 element per indexed transaction; every other value rejects before effects.
- PredicateTile valid shape equals IndexTile valid shape and its producer DataType does not constrain the transfer DataType.
- Packed four-bit uses Data.ValidCol == 2 * Index.ValidCol and one predicate controls the complete byte pair.
- ROWMAJOR, CUBE_M16, and CUBE_M32 are accepted; CUBE_N8 is rejected.
- Participating Local Tiles share the layout class and logical coordinates while retaining independent DataType, TSize, LB2, physical columns, and capacity.
- B.IOR RegSrc0 supplies BaseGPR; RegSrc1, RegSrc2, and RegDst must encode zero.

## State effects

- Closes any preceding block, initializes a new TileMemory descriptor, and selects TLSU function 7 with encoded DataType.
- No Tile is allocated and no source is consumed by the start instruction.

## Memory effects and ordering

### Memory effects

- Each enabled indexed transaction stores one transfer element, or one packed byte containing the low then high logical nibble, at BaseGPR plus the byte displacement.
- A false predicate performs no address generation, translation, permission check, memory probe, event, access, or data-access fault.

### Ordering

- Existing PTO memory ordering and implementation-defined duplicate-address serialization are unchanged.

## Exceptions

- Malformed bundle schema, nonzero unused B.IOR fields, unsupported datatype or layout, descriptor/shape mismatch, noncanonical predicate values, or an access fault rejects before effects.

## Examples

- BSTART.MSCATTER.MASK DataType; B.DATR Layout (optional); B.DIM LB0=ValidCol; B.DIM LB1=ValidRow (optional); B.DIM LB2=Col (optional); B.IOT DataTile, IndexTile, mask=PE_MASK; B.IOT MaskTile, mask=PE_MASK, <last>; B.IOR BaseGPR, zero, zero, ->zero; BSTOP
