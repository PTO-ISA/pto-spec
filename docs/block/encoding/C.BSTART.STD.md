# C.BSTART.STD

**Normative ASL source:** `asl/block/encoding/C.BSTART.STD.asl`

Starts a compressed STD block with fallthrough, indirect, or return transfer; every other BrType rejects before effects.

## Normative identity {#PTO-INST-BLOCK-C-BSTART-STD}

<!-- ndf: kind=executable level=L3 layer=block status=accepted -->

The current instruction contract is owned by the ASL source linked above.

## Assembly

```asm
C.BSTART.STD FALL
C.BSTART.STD IND
C.BSTART.STD RET
```

## Encoding

| Form | Kind | Bits | Match / mask | Constraints |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| c_bstart_std_16_8b40f078c14a | C16 | 16 | 0x0000 / 0xc7ff | [{"field":"BrType","operator":"one-of","values":[1,5,7]}] |

### Fields

| Form | Field | Bits | Signedness | Pieces |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| c_bstart_std_16_8b40f078c14a | BrType | 3 | encoding-defined | [{"instruction_lsb":11,"value_lsb":0,"width":3}] |

## Encoding class

- **Class:** `standalone-encoded`
- **Standalone opcode:** `yes`

## Encoded field closure

Every encoded field value is assigned here, owned by another mnemonic, or reserved by the normative ASL contract.

| Form | Field | Bits | Assigned | Other owner | Reserved | Architectural role | Encoded zero |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| c_bstart_std_16_8b40f078c14a | BrType | 3 | 1, 5, 7 | 0 (C.BSTOP) | 2–4, 6 | encoded transfer kind: FALL, IND, or RET | Encoded zero is owned by C.BSTOP, not C.BSTART.STD. |

- `c_bstart_std_16_8b40f078c14a.BrType` reserved values: Reserved encodings raise Fault_IllegalInstruction before architectural effects.

## Operands and results

| Field | Architectural role |
| --- | --- |
| BrType | encoded transfer kind: FALL, IND, or RET |

## Decode

<!-- GENERATED-ASL-BEGIN: decode source=asl/block/encoding/C.BSTART.STD.asl -->
```asl
readonly func InstructionContractMatches_C_BSTART_STD(operation: CommandOperation) => boolean
begin
    return (operation == CommandOperation_c_bstart_std_16_8b40f078c14a);
end;
```
<!-- GENERATED-ASL-END: decode -->

## Block composition

```asm
After any active predecessor block commits successfully, C.BSTART.STD opens one Standard block. FALL and RET may start without a predecessor; IND requires an active retiring Standard or Floating BARG.
```

## Operation

<!-- GENERATED-ASL-BEGIN: operation source=asl/block/encoding/C.BSTART.STD.asl -->
```asl
pure func InstructionContractBranchTypeLegal_C_BSTART_STD(
    branch_type: bits(3))
    => boolean
begin
    return branch_type == '001' ||
           branch_type == '101' ||
           branch_type == '111';
end;

pure func InstructionContractTransfer_C_BSTART_STD(
    branch_type: bits(3))
    => BundleTransfer
begin
    assert InstructionContractBranchTypeLegal_C_BSTART_STD(branch_type);
    if branch_type == '001' then
        return BundleTransfer_Fallthrough;
    elsif branch_type == '101' then
        return BundleTransfer_Indirect;
    else
        return BundleTransfer_Return;
    end;
end;

readonly func InstructionContractHandler_C_BSTART_STD() => CommandSemanticHandler
begin
    return CommandHandler_ExecuteBundleStart;
end;

## Defaults and encoded zero

- BrType is always encoded; it has no omitted or default form.

## Legality

- c_bstart_std_16_8b40f078c14a.BrType accepts exactly 1 (FALL), 5 (IND), or 7 (RET). Code 0 decodes as C.BSTOP, while codes 2, 3, 4, and 6 do not decode as standalone C.BSTART.STD; code 6 is used only inside fused BSTART.ICALL.

## State effects

- FALL installs a non-selecting sequential Standard BARG. IND installs the snapshotted retiring BARG.BPCN; RET installs the snapshotted architectural return address.
- The installed candidate continuation remains pending until BSTOP or the next BSTART commits the new block.

## Memory effects and ordering

### Memory effects

- none

### Ordering

- Decode and transfer legality precede source selection. IND snapshots retiring BARG.BPCN and RET snapshots architectural ra before predecessor retirement.
- Target alignment is checked before retirement; the new Standard BARG is installed only after successful retirement.

## Exceptions

- BrType code 0 is C.BSTOP. Codes 2, 3, 4, and 6 do not decode as standalone C.BSTART.STD and raise Fault_IllegalInstruction before effects.
- IND without an active retiring Standard or Floating BARG raises Fault_BundleControl before effects. An odd snapshotted BARG.BPCN or return address raises Fault_InstructionPC before predecessor retirement.
- If predecessor commit fails, the retiring block remains authoritative and no Standard BARG is installed.

## Examples

- C.BSTART.STD FALL
- C.BSTART.STD IND
- C.BSTART.STD RET
