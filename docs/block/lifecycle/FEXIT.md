## Encoded field closure

Every encoded field value is assigned here, owned by another mnemonic, or reserved by the normative ASL contract.

| Form | Field | Bits | Assigned | Other owner | Reserved | Architectural role | Encoded zero |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fexit_32_37b663f2a34d | DstBegin | 5 | 2–23 | none | 0–1, 24–31 | first register in the inclusive R2..R23 ring range | Encoded zero is outside the callee-save ring and is reserved. |
| fexit_32_37b663f2a34d | DstEnd | 5 | 2–23 | none | 0–1, 24–31 | last register in the inclusive R2..R23 ring range | Encoded zero is outside the callee-save ring and is reserved. |
| fexit_32_37b663f2a34d | uimm | 15 | 0–32767 | none | none | frame byte count, encoded in multiples of eight | Encoded zero is a real zero-byte frame size and is illegal for every nonempty range. |

- `fexit_32_37b663f2a34d.DstBegin` reserved values: Reserved encodings raise Fault_IllegalInstruction before architectural effects.
- `fexit_32_37b663f2a34d.DstEnd` reserved values: Reserved encodings raise Fault_IllegalInstruction before architectural effects.

## Operands and results

| Field | Architectural role |
| --- | --- |
| DstBegin | first register in the inclusive R2..R23 ring range |
| DstEnd | last register in the inclusive R2..R23 ring range |
| uimm | frame byte count, encoded in multiples of eight |

## Defaults and encoded zero

- The inclusive register range is the ring R2..R23. Singleton, full-ring, and wraparound ranges are assigned.
- uimm is always present and represents a byte count in multiples of eight; encoded zero is real zero and is illegal because every assigned range contains at least one register.

## Legality

- DstBegin and DstEnd select the inclusive R2..R23 callee-save ring; every endpoint outside 2..23 is reserved before effects.
- If the range contains N registers, uimm must be at least 8*N bytes. The encoding supplies only multiples of eight.

## State effects

- The accepted start records instruction PC, endpoints, count, frame size, reconstructed caller sp, and zero progress.
- After the final load, decrement nonzero frame depth, publish the last-frame tuple, clear active progress, and retire once.

## Memory effects and ordering

### Memory effects

- Load one aligned eight-byte value per selected destination from caller_sp-8, caller_sp-16, and subsequent descending slots.

### Ordering

- Add uimm to sp first, then load descending caller-frame slots in inclusive register-ring order.
- Each load, destination write, and progress advance commit as one restart event; recovery does not add sp twice or repeat earlier loads.

## Exceptions

- Reserved endpoints or an insufficient frame size raise Fault_IllegalInstruction before sp, register, memory, target, progress, or TPC effects.
- Each eight-byte stack access is a restart boundary. A recoverable access fault preserves earlier committed events and retries exactly the first uncommitted event from trap-preserved template state.

## Examples

- FEXIT [RegDst0 ~ RegDstn], sp!, uimm
