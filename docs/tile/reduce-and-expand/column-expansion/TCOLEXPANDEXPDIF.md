# TCOLEXPANDEXPDIF

**Normative ASL source:** `asl/tile/reduce-and-expand/column-expansion/TCOLEXPANDEXPDIF.asl`

Exponentiate the typed difference between a full-shape source and a broadcast one-row vector.

## Normative identity {#PTO-INST-TILE-TCOLEXPANDEXPDIF}

<!-- ndf: kind=executable level=L3 layer=tile status=accepted -->

The current instruction contract is owned by the ASL source linked above.

## Reader guide

> **Non-normative explanation.** Exact behavior remains owned by the ASL source and generated contract on this page.

## What TCOLEXPANDEXPDIF does

`TCOLEXPANDEXPDIF` is a selector-encoded Tile operation executed by `SFU`. It computes the typed exponential of each full-shape element minus its same-column broadcast value; its current instruction contract owns the exact bundle form and publication boundary.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: tile-tcolexpandexpdif-mechanism role=mechanism -->
## Element and Tile mechanism

After all descriptor and operand checks succeed, the owning ASL handler computes the typed exponential of each full-shape element minus its same-column broadcast value. Source payloads are snapshotted before destination writes whenever the contract permits aliasing.

The handler uses the resolved valid region rather than treating physical padding as input data. Its operation-specific dtype, layout, rounding, saturation, and profile hooks remain the executable definition.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: tile-tcolexpandexpdif-inputs role=inputs-outputs -->
## Operand roles and descriptors

- `destination0` has the exact contract role **new Local DstDataType destination**.
- `source0` has the exact contract role **persistent Local full-shape numeric source**.
- `source1` has the exact contract role **persistent Local one-row broadcast source**.

Participating source and destination descriptors use the row-major and shape relationships stated by the current contract.
Every source coordinate read by the operation must be defined before execution reaches destination publication.
`PE_MASK=0000` is a strict no-op before descriptor, allocation, payload, numeric-status, or memory effects.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: tile-tcolexpandexpdif-effects role=effects -->
## Publication, definedness, and padding

Destination-visible state is published only after complete preflight; where the contract names atomic publication, payload, descriptor, definedness, padding, and status become visible together.

Physical coordinates outside the valid rectangle follow the contract-selected padding rule; `Null` padding remains undefined when that rule applies.

The operation has no GM memory effect; descriptor, payload, definedness, padding, and numeric-status changes are limited to those listed by the current contract.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: tile-tcolexpandexpdif-constraints role=constraints -->
## Type, layout, and fault boundary

The exact accepted type or type-pair set is owned by the generated legality section below; this guide does not widen it.

The generated legality and exception sections below are authoritative for dtype pairs, layout, dimensions, capacity, definedness, padding controls, profile behavior, and fault class. Legality and allocation failures occur before partial architectural effects.

## Non-normative worked example

This example illustrates the current ASL owner and does not replace the normative operation.

For a small `TCOLEXPANDEXPDIF` example, equal full-shape and broadcast values have difference zero, so their exponential result is one.

This operation has no standalone opcode.

## Field value dispositions

### B.DATR.PadValueOrByteId (`PTO-FIELD-BLOCK-PADVALUE-OR-BYTEID`)

Carries the operation-selected PadValue or ByteId union field.

**Encoded zero:** For PadValue operations code zero selects Zero; for ByteId operations it selects ByteId zero.

| Code | Disposition | Meaning |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | assigned | Zero-or-ByteId0 |
| 1 | assigned | Max-or-ByteId1 |
| 2 | assigned | Min-or-ByteId2 |
| 3 | assigned | Null-or-ByteId3 |

**Reserved-value behavior:** All four encodings are assigned; the selected operation separately validates whether the field is PadValue, ByteId, or inapplicable.

### DataType (`PTO-FIELD-BLOCK-DATATYPE`)

Selects the Tile element data type carried by Block data attributes and typed Block starts.

**Encoded zero:** Code zero selects FP64; zero never means absent, inherited, NONE, or NULL.

| Code | Disposition | Meaning |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | assigned | FP64 |
| 1 | assigned | FP32 |
| 2 | assigned | TF32 |
| 3 | assigned | HF32 |
| 4 | assigned | FP16 |
| 5 | assigned | BF16 |
| 6 | assigned | HiF8 |

| 27 | assigned | U8 |
| 28 | assigned | U4X2 |
| 29 | reserved | future extension |
| 30 | reserved | future extension |
| 31 | reserved | future extension |

**Reserved-value behavior:** Reserved values are held for future extension and reject before architectural effects.

## Defaults and encoded zero

- LB0 is required and supplies nonzero ValidCol. Omitted LB1 selects ValidRow=1. Omitted LB2 selects Col=ValidCol; every explicitly present dimension must be nonzero.
- Omitted B.DATR selects DstDataType=SrcDataType and PadValue=Null. When B.DATR is present, DTYPE_NONE inherits SrcDataType, a concrete DataType selects DstDataType, and encoded DataType zero selects FP64 and is never absence. Explicit PadValue 00, 01, 10, and 11 select Zero, Max, Min, and Null.

## Legality

- TROWEXPANDEXPDIF and TCOLEXPANDEXPDIF accept exactly (FP16,FP16), (BF16,BF16), (FP32,FP32), (FP16,FP32), and (BF16,FP32) as (SrcDataType,DstDataType) pairs.
- BSTART DataType selects SrcDataType; omitted B.DATR or explicit DataType=DTYPE_NONE selects DstDataType=SrcDataType; a concrete B.DATR DataType selects DstDataType. Source0 and BroadcastTile use SrcDataType and the destination uses DstDataType.
- Mixed FP16/BF16 to FP32 widens both source operands exactly to FP32 before FP32 subtraction and FP32 exponential. Same-type pairs retain their selected type.
- The destination is a newly allocated FP32-capacity result for mixed pairs; no cross-type alias or reinterpret view is introduced.
- The broadcast source has logical ValidRow equal to one and ValidCol equal to the destination; physical extents are derived from the selected layout.
- The full-shape source and destination have identical logical valid geometry and the selected layout; physical geometry is derived per layout.
- Every source is a fully defined numeric Tile in the selected RowMajor, CUBE_M16, or CUBE_M32 layout with valid numeric encodings.
- PadValueOrByteId and DataType are the only applicable B.DATR fields. B.IOR and B.IOS are illegal.
- All operands share one PE_MASK; PE_MASK=0000 is a strict no-op before descriptor reads, allocation, faults, status, or payload effects.

## State effects

- For every valid destination element, source0 and BroadcastTile are interpreted as SrcDataType. For mixed FP16/BF16 to FP32 pairs, widen both exactly to FP32, then compute FP32 source0 - BroadcastTile and FP32 natural exponential. Same-type pairs preserve the existing selected-type sequence.
- The subtraction and exponential stages apply in sequence and their numeric-status flags are accumulated into one transaction.
- Apply the selected PadValue to physical destination coordinates outside the valid result rectangle.
- Publish the complete renamed destination atomically after every element succeeds.

## Memory effects and ordering

### Memory effects

- none

### Ordering

- Complete schema, attribute, dimension, source/destination type-pair, descriptor, source-definedness, source-encoding, mask, capacity, name-allocation, and storage preflight precedes every source snapshot.
- All source payloads are snapshotted before result construction; sources persist and same-type legal aliases use read-old/write-new behavior.
- Numeric status, all valid results, selected padding definedness, and the renamed destination descriptor publish atomically; rejection publishes none.

## Exceptions

- A malformed binding stream, B.IOR or B.IOS presence, missing or zero dimension, unsupported source/destination DataType pair, unsupported, mixed, or mismatched source layout, undefined source element, invalid source encoding, or mismatched source geometry raises Fault_TileLegality before effects.
- An unrepresentable destination shape, insufficient TSize, unavailable renamed destination, or exhausted Tile capacity raises Fault_TileAllocation before destination publication.
- All valid results, numeric status, selected padding definedness, and the renamed destination descriptor publish atomically; rejection publishes none.

## Examples

- BSTART.SFU TCOLEXPANDEXPDIF, SrcDataType; B.DATR DataType, PadValue (optional); B.DIM LB0=ValidCol; B.DIM LB1=ValidRow (optional); B.DIM LB2=Col (optional); B.IOT SrcTile, BroadcastTile, mask=PE_MASK, <last>, ->DstTile<TSize>; BSTOP
