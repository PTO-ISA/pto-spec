# TCI

**Normative ASL source:** `asl/tile/irregular-and-complex/initialization/TCI.asl`

Generate one ascending or descending typed integer sequence in a new single-row Local Tile.

## Normative identity {#PTO-INST-TILE-TCI}

<!-- ndf: kind=executable level=L3 layer=tile status=accepted -->

The current instruction contract is owned by the ASL source linked above.

## Reader guide

## What TCI does

`TCI` is a selector-encoded Tile operation executed by `SFU`. It forms one typed single-row sequence from the bound start value, increasing or decreasing by logical column; its current instruction contract owns the exact bundle form and publication boundary.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: tile-tci-mechanism role=mechanism -->
## Element and Tile mechanism

After all descriptor and operand checks succeed, the owning ASL handler forms one typed single-row sequence from the bound start value, increasing or decreasing by logical column. Source payloads are snapshotted before destination writes whenever the contract permits aliasing.

The handler uses the resolved valid region rather than treating physical padding as input data. Its operation-specific dtype, layout, rounding, saturation, and profile hooks remain the executable definition.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: tile-tci-inputs role=inputs-outputs -->
## Operand roles and descriptors

- `destination0` has the exact contract role **new Local S32, S16, U32, or U16 destination**.
- `scalar0` has the exact contract role **typed sequence start**.
- `flag0` has the exact contract role **ascending or descending direction**.

Participating source and destination descriptors use the row-major and shape relationships stated by the current contract.
`PE_MASK=0000` is a strict no-op before descriptor, allocation, payload, numeric-status, or memory effects.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: tile-tci-effects role=effects -->
## Publication, definedness, and padding

Destination-visible state is published only after complete preflight; where the contract names atomic publication, payload, descriptor, definedness, padding, and status become visible together.

Physical coordinates outside the valid rectangle follow the contract-selected padding rule; `Null` padding remains undefined when that rule applies.

The operation has no GM memory effect; descriptor, payload, definedness, padding, and numeric-status changes are limited to those listed by the current contract.

<!-- PTO-READER-BLOCK: tile-tci-constraints role=constraints -->
## Type, layout, and fault boundary

The accepted data-type set is `S32`, `S16`, `U32`, `U16`.

The generated legality and exception sections below are authoritative for dtype pairs, layout, dimensions, capacity, definedness, padding controls, profile behavior, and fault class. Legality and allocation failures occur before partial architectural effects.

## Non-normative worked example

This example illustrates the current ASL owner and does not replace the normative operation.

For a small `TCI` example, start `2` in ascending mode over three valid columns produces `[2, 3, 4]`.

## Defaults and encoded zero

- LB0 is required and supplies nonzero ValidCol. Omitted LB1 selects ValidRow one; an explicit LB1 must also equal one. Omitted LB2 selects Col equal to ValidCol.
- Omitted B.IOR selects start zero and ascending direction. An explicitly present all-zero B.IOR is a distinct descriptor with the same operand values.
- Omitted B.DATR selects the operation defaults. A present B.DATR is legal only when every encoded field is zero. Physical padding is always Null.

## Legality

- TCI is selected by the TEPL encoding carrier Mode 3 Function 6, canonically assembled with BSTART.SFU, and has no standalone opcode.
- Exactly one terminating destination-only Local B.IOT supplies one newly allocated destination. Every source binding, a second B.IOT, B.IOS, or an unterminated binding stream is illegal.
- The selected DataType is exactly S32, S16, U32, or U16. The destination is row-major, ValidRow is one, ValidCol is nonzero, and Col is at least ValidCol.
- A present B.IOR consumes RegSrc0 as the raw start value and RegSrc1 as an exact zero or one direction. Bits above the selected start width are ignored. RegSrc2 and RegDst are zero.
- Every explicit nonzero B.DATR field is illegal. PE_MASK zero is a strict no-op before GPR reads, descriptor checks, allocation, faults, or payload effects.

## State effects

- For logical column k, ascending TCI writes start plus k and descending TCI writes start minus k.
- Sequence arithmetic wraps modulo the selected element width. Only ValidRow zero participates.
- Every physical destination coordinate outside the one-row valid region is undefined Null padding.

## Memory effects and ordering

### Memory effects

- none

### Ordering

- Complete schema, type, dimensions, TSize, direction, mask, destination-name, and allocation preflight precedes the private-GPR snapshots.
- The sequence payload, Null padding definedness, and renamed destination descriptor publish atomically; rejection publishes none.

## Exceptions

- Malformed bindings, B.IOS, unsupported DataType, non-row-major layout, missing or invalid dimensions, direction other than zero or one, or a nonzero inapplicable B.DATR field raises Fault_TileLegality before allocation.
- An unrepresentable shape, unavailable renamed destination, insufficient TSize, or exhausted Tile capacity raises Fault_TileAllocation before allocation.
- PE_MASK zero completes as a strict no-op before every validation or effect.

## Examples

- BSTART.SFU TCI, U16; B.DIM LB0=16; B.IOR a0, a1; B.IOT mask=1111, <last>, ->T0<1>; BSTOP
